Real-Time IoT Security with Machine Learning

Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing IoT security by leveraging machine learning to detect and mitigate cyberattacks in real-time. The goal is to identify suspicious patterns in IoT device communication and flag them before they can compromise the network.

The Challenge
As IoT devices become widely used in business environments, they are increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks. Traditional security methods struggle to keep up with evolving threats, leaving systems exposed to attacks such as:

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
Malware intrusions
Unauthorized access
Businesses face risks like data breaches, operational downtime, and significant financial losses due to these vulnerabilities.

My Approach
We are developing a machine learning model that analyzes IoT communication patterns to differentiate between 'normal' and 'attack' behaviors. This enables real-time threat detection, allowing businesses to proactively address vulnerabilities and protect their networks from potential intrusions.

Project Workflow
Data Preparation: Handle missing values and preprocess categorical data with one-hot encoding.
Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and test sets.
Resampling with SMOTE: Balance the training data to manage class imbalances.
Normalization with MinMaxScaler: Normalize the data to bring features to a uniform scale.
Model Training: Train the model using the balanced and scaled data.
Evaluation: Assess the model using precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC for a comprehensive understanding of its performance.


Business Value
The business impact of this project is substantial:

Proactive Security: Identifies threats in real-time, enabling quick response and mitigation.
Reduced Downtime: Minimizes disruptions by protecting against cyberattacks before they escalate.
Data Protection: Safeguards sensitive business information and maintains network integrity.
Operational Continuity: Ensures that IoT devices and networks remain secure and functional, promoting resilience against potential threats.
By leveraging machine learning for real-time IoT security, businesses can build a robust defense system that adapts to the changing landscape of cyber threats.
